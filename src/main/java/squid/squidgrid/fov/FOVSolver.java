/**
 * An interface for Field of View algorithms.
 *
 * FIeld of View (FOV) algorithms determine how much area surrounding a point
 * can be seen. They return a two dimensional array of floats, representing the
 * amount of view (typically sight, but perhaps sound, smell, etc.) which the
 * origin has of each cell.
 *
 * The force parameter allows tiles to have a varying resistance to the kind of
 * rays emanating from the source. This parameter is a percentage of light
 * passed so 1f or higher will block all light. 0f or lower will block no light.
 *
 * If a simple radius is desired, set the resistance of your cells to 0f, the force
 * to 1f, and the decay to 1f / (the radius).
 *
 * The coordinates of the returned structure match those of the input grid.
 *
 * Some solvers expect the edges of the map to have opaque cells. Since there
 * are no bounds checking in the these algorithms, they will fail if the edges
 * are not opaque. Check the documentation for the individual solvers for more
 * details.
